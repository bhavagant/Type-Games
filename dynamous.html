    <h1>ABOUT DYNAMOUS WORLD</h1>
<p>The game takes place entirely in the River Village (a location that will later become recurring throughout the series). The player, as soon as he starts the game from the beginning, will be assisted by Jovani , a researcher and scholar of Dynamons , who provides him with the basics of the Dynamon fight. Here, the player will learn the basics with Jovani's Vulfrost while facing a Menza (also Jovani).

    After the training battle, Jovani offers the player a choice between a Tailton , a Nintoise , and a Pyropine . Here, the player will have to start forming his team of Dynamons along the promontory, where Tommi is waiting for him , who will challenge him with a Menza and a Podapod . Once Tommi is defeated, the player will travel to the highlands, where he will be challenged by Roxi , who has a Rexaroo , a Tailton and a Vulfrost . After crossing the bridge, the player arrives in the Badlands, where he will meet Fredrik , who challenges the player with a Pumpking , a Vulfrost and a Flarion . Once Fredrik has also been defeated, the player will access the caves, where he will have a final, but intense battle with Dominik , who has a Lampion , an Aviatos and a Flarion . The game ends with Dominik's defeat, and with Jovani taking his leave of the player, inviting him to capture more Dynamons.</p>
