    Gameplay
    Modes
    The game combines role-playing, real-time strategy and city-building mechanics.[5] Its gameplay consists of several game modes, the most notable of which are PVP-battles. Players develop their own base and build an army in order to attack enemy bases, destroy them, seize resources and capture enemy leaders. Usually, players can attack only enemies from their own kingdom, but during the Kingdom War (KvK), all servers (excluding new servers) are opened for attacks. Players can attack monsters and "Darknests" that periodically appear on the kingdom map in order to claim resources from them. In addition to the usual attacks, players can participate in contests, the purpose of which is to capture a location on the map, earning bonuses either for themselves or the guild that they are a part of.</p>
